## About Me

Hello, my name is Carolyn Jones. I am a rising senior at Williams College, majoring in Computer Science and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. I am from Western Massachusetts, about twenty minutes south of Williams. In my free time, I love spending time with my dogs and family, being outdoors, and crafting or cooking with friends.

My past computer science research focused on developing a curriculum for elementary students using Lego Robotics, aiming to encourage more young girls and other underrepresented identities in STEM to explore computer science. Last summer, I helped run a week-long camp for 4th and 5th grade girls in the community. This summer, I am thrilled to be working with Professor Jiang at the University of Florida.

He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota in 2016 and a B.E. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2010. His research focuses on data mining, machine learning, and AI, with an emphasis on spatiotemporal data mining for applications in Earth sciences, agriculture, transportation, and public health. His work is supported by federal agencies like NSF and NOAA, as well as industry partners; additionally he is a senior member of IEEE.

## About My Project

Continuing from Professor Jiang's work with GeoAI I plan to be turning some of his work into a high school module
