After I spend the first few weeks mainly working on learning hte bafkground info neeeded to work with this kind of geo spatial data, week 3-5 was spent creating the first GeoAI module that teschers can use to learn and eventually teach GeoAI in schools. The module is a Google Colab, so it is part text and part code. The text explains all the background info needed: machine learning. GeoAI, Geospatial date, etc. The code blocks walks through an example of stream detection using UNET archecture.
