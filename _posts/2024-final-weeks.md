The last few weeks of this oppurtunity flew by. I worked alot on the third module, which unlike the previous two covered unsupervised learning, specifically the foundation model. Usung the segment anything repository from github the final module walked thorugh an applicaitno of segment anyhitng. Additionally, I worked on my final report. It was hard to write as I dont have a ton of experiance writing techincal papers, but it was really nice to think about my project holistically in that matter and ask myself why I am working on this project.
