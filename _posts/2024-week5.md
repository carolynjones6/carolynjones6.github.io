title: Week 5

These next two weeks were spent mainly cleaning up my two modules. I want them to be completely self contained tutorials. I worked on collecting all of my sources so they are included in the module. I worked to add some aesthetic feautures, like adding visuals, headings, etc. I also started the background reading  needed  to start the third and final module. While the pervioud two modules focused on supervised learning, the third module will work with unsupervised learning, particularly the foundation model.
